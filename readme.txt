numbers.txt is a plain text file that contains 20 million lines. Each line
contains exactly one 32-bit unsigned integer. You have to write a program that
reads the file and prints the sum of 10 smallest numbers in that file.

For example if the file was

```
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
2
0
0
0
```

The answer would be 7.

A solution in Ruby could be:

You're allowed to use any programming language you want but the goal is to
write a program that finishes as quickly as possible. You're free to use
concurrency, external libraries, whatever you want. Just be quick.

I have written a 1 line Ruby script that finishes in roughly 10 seconds.
Consider that the time you have to beat :) I also have a solution in Rust but
I'll share the time of that script during my talk.

You have until the end of next week Monday (the 17th) to PM me the answer, the
time your program takes to run, and the source code. I will buy everyone who
submits an answer a beer next time we're at the bodega.
